		<h1>About this class</h1>
		<p>
			I am very glad that I can take the classes provided by NYUSPS. The most interesting thing for me about this class is it enables me to explore about web and web designing, I think I can convert what I learn from this class to my tools of creating good websites.

		<h1>My attitude towards website</h1>
		<p>
			Great convenience and plenty resources make me cannot live without website, it is so good and necessary. I need to submit my paper and assignment through schoology during school time. Youtube, taobao, weibo, google, these are also the websites I often use.</p>
		<p>
			But sometimes some website advocate bad stuff and comments that triggered me. And it occupies a lot of time.
